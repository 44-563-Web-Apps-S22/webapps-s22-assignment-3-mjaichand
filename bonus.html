        <p><b>Macaws</b> are a group of New World parrots that are long-tailed and often colorful. They are popular in aviculture or as companion parrots, although there are conservation concerns about several species in the wild.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The largest macaws are the hyacinth, Buffon's (great green) and green-winged macaws.</li>
            <li>There are 19 species of macaws, including extinct and critically endangered species.</li>
            <li>Some foods eaten by macaws in certain regions in the wild are said to contain toxic or caustic substances which they are able to digest.</li>
