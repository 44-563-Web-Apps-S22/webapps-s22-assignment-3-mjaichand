        <h1>Nannaku Prematho</h1>
        <p>
            This is one of the best film in terms of screenplay, which engrossed the audience very well. Jr. NTR as usual, performed well to the gallery. Director Sukumar sir have included several mathematical theories in the film, which makes it gripping till the end. He have brought in the mind games between hero and villain(Jagapathi Babu) very well in an interesting manner. As usual, Jagapathi Babu played his role well, that too with negative shades. Others like Rakul Pretty Singh, Rajiv Kanakala, Srinivas Avasarla and Rajendra Prasad were good. Overall I enjoyed a lot while watching the movie.
